## SARS-CoV-2 analyses for African's countries part of the African and Malagasy Council for Higher Education [(CAMES)](https://www.lecames.org/)

These analyses represent country-, region, and institution-level phylogenies for African countries.
The phylogenetic context sources from Nextstrain's Africa-focused regional builds, data for which are available through GISAID's "nextregions" downloads.
The rest of the phylogeny uses up to 6,000 sequences per country.
